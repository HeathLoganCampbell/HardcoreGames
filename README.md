# HardcoreGames
A classic gamemode from MCPVP which is like a battle royale

## Game play
You select a kit while waiting for 100 other players to join the server, these kits can give special abilities which will influence how you play the game.
the game starts with everyone having grace period for 2 minutes. After that it's a fight to the death, where players can attack each other. Last man standing wins.

Also around the 24 minute mark, a feast spawns with extremely good loot which speeds up the end of the game.
